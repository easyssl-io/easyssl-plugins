# Publishes release VERSION of Plugin PLUGIN as a GitHub Release, after
# scripts/release.sh recorded and tagged it and the tag was pushed:
#
#   scripts/publish-release.sh apache 0.3.0
#
# Builds the tag again, in a worktree of its own, refuses unless every build's SHA-256 is the one `<PLUGIN>/releases.json`
# records, and creates
# the GitHub Release `<PLUGIN>/v<VERSION>` with the builds, a SHA256SUMS file
# and the `describe` answer, its notes the version's CHANGELOG.md entry. A
# Server pinned at the tag downloads these builds and checks them against the
# same record, so every installation hands out the bytes released. The record
# is read at the tag, or, for a release tagged before releases.json existed and
# recorded by the first release after it, at HEAD.
#
# Only finished releases are published; a development build is served by the
# Server that built it. Needs gh, signed in with permission to create releases,
# and jq.
